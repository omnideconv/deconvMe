\usage{
run_methatlas(
  beta_matrix,
  reference_atlas = system.file("reference_atlas.csv", package = "deconvMe"),
  temp_dir = NULL,
  out_dir = NULL,
  use_epic_reference = FALSE,
  cpg_subset = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta_matrix}{a beta matrix with CpGs in rows and samples in columns}

\item{reference_atlas}{Path to a csv file that saves a reference matrix with CpGs as rows and cell types as columns.
The default (tissue-wide) reference file is stored in 'inst/reference_atlas.csv'.}

\item{temp_dir}{Path to directory where the beta matrix will be saved as a csv file.}

\item{out_dir}{Path to output directory. Output will be a csv file and a png representing the cell type fractions.}

\item{use_epic_reference}{The MethAtlas has a whole-tissue reference or a immunecell-specific reference that is optimized for EPIC arrays (which is a subset of the whole-tissue reference)}

\item{cpg_subset}{Optional character vector of CpGs to subset the signature matrix. Default: NULL (use all CpGs in the signature).}
