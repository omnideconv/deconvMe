run_epidish(
  beta_matrix,
  mode = c("RPC", "CBS", "CP"),
  reference = c("blood", "breast", "epithelial"),
  maxit = 50,
  nu.v = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.7),

}
\arguments{
\item{beta_matrix}{a beta matrix with CpGs in rows and samples in columns}

\item{mode}{Choice of a reference-based method ('RPC','CBS','CP')}

\item{reference}{A matrix of reference 'centroids', i.e. representative molecular profiles,
for a number of cell subtypes. rows label molecular features (e.g. CpGs,...)
and columns label the cell-type. IDs need to be provided as rownames and
colnames, respectively. Missing value is not allowed, and all values in
this matrix should be positive or zero. For DNAm data, values should be
beta-values.}

\item{maxit}{Only used in RPC mode, the limit of the number of IWLS iterations}

\item{nu.v}{Only used in CBS mode. It is a vector of several candidate nu values. nu is
parameter needed for nu-classification, nu-regression, and
one-classification in svm. The best estimation results among all candidate nu
will be automatically returned.}

\item{constraint}{Only used in CP mode, you can choose either of 'inequality' or 'equality'
normalization constraint. The default is 'inequality' (i.e sum of weights
adds to a number less or equal than 1), which was implemented in
Houseman et al (2012).}
