# Contributing a New Method to deconvMe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **deconvMe**! This guide will help you add a new cell-type deconvolution method to the package.

## 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

- Fork the [deconvMe GitHub repository](https://github.com/omnideconv/deconvMe).
- Clone your fork locally and create a new branch for your feature.

## 2. Add Your Method Implementation

- Add a new R script for your method in the `R/` directory (e.g., `mynewmethod.R`).
- Follow the structure of existing methods (see files like `epidish.R`, `houseman.R`, etc.).
- Your function should:
    - Accept a beta matrix or methylSet as input.
    - Return results in a format consistent with other methods (see `run_epidish`, `run_houseman`, etc.).
    - Include roxygen2 documentation.

## 3. Register Your Method

- If your method should be accessible via the unified interface (`deconvolute` or `deconvolute_combined`), update the relevant logic in `main.R`.
- Add your method to the list of supported methods and document any new parameters.

## 4. Expose All Method Parameters via deconvMe

To ensure users can fully utilize your new method, make sure that all relevant parameters of your function are accessible through the main deconvMe interfaces (`deconvolute` and/or `deconvolute_combined`).

- Update the argument handling in `main.R` so that users can pass any method-specific parameters when calling these functions.
- Clearly document these parameters in your function's roxygen2 documentation and in the main interface documentation if needed.
- This approach ensures flexibility and makes your method as useful as possible for a wide range of use cases.

## 5. Document Your Method

- Add a roxygen2 documentation block to your function.
- Run `devtools::document()` to update the manual files in `man/`.
- Optionally, add an example to the README or a new vignette.

## 6. Add Tests

- Add tests for your method in `tests/testthat/` (see `test_methods.R` for examples).
- Ensure your method is covered by the test suite.

## 7. Check and Build

- Run `devtools::check()` to ensure your changes pass all checks.
- Build the documentation site locally with `pkgdown::build_site()` to preview your changes.

## 8. Submit a Pull Request

- Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the main repository.
- Describe your changes and reference any related issues.

## 9. Code Review

- Address any feedback or requested changes from the maintainers.
